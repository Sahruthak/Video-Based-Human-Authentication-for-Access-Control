# Video-Based-Dynamic-Human-Authentication-for-Access-Control using opencv and numpy

# Dynamic Desktop Application


The Video based dynamic human authentication system authorizes
individuals via face recognition technology. It captures a video of each user,
converts it into pictures, and creates a trained model for each user using
LBPH algorithm. Upon entry, it compares the captured image with the trained
model. Authenticated users are granted access, while unauthenticated users
trigger an alarm for added security. This system enhances access control
and is applicable in various industries. LBPH algorithm ensures reliable
authentication.
